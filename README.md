## Description

_forall x: Calgary_ is a full-featured textbook on formal logic. It covers key
notions of logic such as consequence and validity of arguments, the
syntax of truth-functional propositional logic TFL and truth-table
semantics, the syntax of first-order (predicate) logic FOL with
identity (first-order interpretations), translating (formalizing)
English in TFL and FOL, and Fitch-style natural deduction proof
systems for both TFL and FOL. It also deals with some advanced topics
such as truth-functional completeness. Exercises with solutions are
available. It is provided in PDF (for screen reading, printing, and a
special version for dyslexics) and in LaTeX source code. A proof
editor/checker for the proof system used is available at
[proofs.openlogicproject.org](http://proofs.openlogicproject.org/).

Note that these files change whenevery the source files are
changed. So if you use the text in a course, better to download the
PDFs and make them available to students directly, than to link here.

## Buy a Printed Copy

If you'd like to purchase a nice paperback copy, you can do so on
Amazon ([US](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1077319851) | [CA](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/1077319851) | 
[UK](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1077319851)) (or use search in your local Amazon store).

(The process for getting the book printed is described [here](http://openlogicproject.org/2015/11/22/getting-your-book-to-print/) and [here](http://openlogicproject.org/2017/05/19/forall-x-yyc-is-now-on-amazon-and-how-it-got-there/).)

## Make PDFs Yourself

Clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rzach/forallx-yyc) locally or download the ZIP file and run [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/) on one of

  - `forallxyyc.tex` (in color, for screen reading)
  - `forallxyyc-accessible.tex` (accessible version)
  - `forallxyyc-print.tex` (b/w, for printing on Quarto stock)
  - `forallxyyc-letter.tex` (b/w, for printing on regular letter-size paper)

You'll have to run `makeglossaries` to produce the glossary as well.

To make changes to the definitions in the preamble and `forallyyc.sty`
file, put them in a file named `forallxyyc-local.sty`. For instance,
to get the connectives to be & for and and horseshoe for the
conditional, copy `forallxyyc-local-sample.sty` to that file.
